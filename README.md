# 🌳 Decision Tree Diabetes Progression Predictor

## 📌 About
**Decision Tree Regression** is a non-linear model that predicts a target variable by splitting the dataset into branches based on feature values. It uses if-else rules to form a tree structure, where each leaf node represents a predicted value, making it easy to interpret and visualize.

## 📊 Dataset
We use the **Diabetes dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, which contains medical details to predict disease progression.  
Features used:
- **Age** (years)
- **BMI** (kg/m²)
- **Blood Pressure** (mm Hg)
- **S5 Serum Measurement** (lab test)
- **S1 Serum Measurement** (lab test)

Target: A quantitative measure of diabetes progression one year after baseline.
